#Code Book for Course Project

### Description of Work Performed
In the original data set, key information is scattered in various files across training and testing groups. The purpose of the analysis is to derive a tidy dataset that has the appropriate variable and activity labeling, and with the mean computed for each subject and activity.


### Activities and Participating Subjects
* Activities: the activities being monitored:
  * Walking
  * Walking Upstairs
  * Walking Downstairs
  * Sitting
  * Standing
  * Laying
* Subjects: subject id for each of the 30 participating subjects
